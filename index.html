					<h3>OUR IDEA</h3> <!--the p id="rcorners", allows me in the css file to have a border around my paragraphs-->
					<p id="rcorners">We wanted to share the idea of a campus garden. Within this garden it will have space for food to be grown. There will also be solar panels, which can help provide energy for the college in an eco friendly way.This also allows for the opprotunity to create a gardening society, bringing people together. We think that adding a campus garden has a variety of benefits for the college.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="para2">
					<h3><span class="greenSpan">BENEFITS</span></h3> <!--the span colours specific text, I only want to colour the benefits, so I open the span tag before the "benefits" and close the tag after-->
					<p id="rcorners1">Growing food can reduce carbon emissions, and can also allow students to buy freshly grown produce. The college also gains more money from students buying directly from them. Reducing carbon emissions in this area would be beneficial as the luas runs right by the college and many cars are driving by each day. The solar panels allow energy to be produced in a eco friendly way. It also allows for a garden society to be created.</</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="para3">
					<h3>MENTAL HEALTH <span class="greenSpan">BENEFITS</span></h3>
					<p id="rcorners2">If we do have a campus garden and create a gardening society here are some benefits. Gardening can be relaxing. Studies show that gardening can lessen stress, and anxiety. It also makes people take part in physical activity. People can get vitamin D and fresh air by participating in gardening activities. Gardening also gives a great sense of accomplishing something once everything has been grown.</</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="para4">
					<h3>ENERGY <span class="greenSpan">BENEFITS</span></h3>
					<p id="rcorners">Solar panels are a sustainable way to create renewable energy. It can help reduce fossil fuels in the area. Solar panels also reduce energy costs, which woud be great for the college as it has to power many classrooms. Solar energy has an important role in reducing carbon emissions and reduce the effects of climate change. </</p>
				</div>

				<div class="para5">
					<h3>BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER</h3>
					<p id="rcorners1">Having a campus garden allows a gardening society to be created. This can create a greater sense of community within the college. Having a campus garden also allows for another space for people to relax in, and get fresh air and vitamin D. </</p>
